discription: program that simulates a simple bank ATM system. The user has an initial balance of $1000. The ATM should display a menu with options to:

    Check Balance
    Deposit Money
    Withdraw Money
    Exit

The program should run in a loop until the user chooses to exit. For each option, use if, elif, and else to manage each choice. Ensure that the balance doesnâ€™t go below zero during a withdrawal.
